    <p>As August winds down and September approaches, homeowners across South Central Iowa are asking the same question:</p>
    <p><strong>👉 Will my roof make it through another Iowa Fall?</strong></p>
    <p>At Hackney Roofing, we see it every year — small summer storm damage turns into major winter leaks once snow and ice arrive. Don’t wait until freezing temperatures trap you with no options.</p>

    <h2>5 Signs Your Roof May Not Survive the Season</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Curling, Cracked, or Missing Shingles</strong> – Often caused by hail and high winds.</li>
      <li><strong>Leaks or Water Stains in Your Attic</strong> – A red flag that melting snow will make worse.</li>
      <li><strong>Granules Collecting in Gutters</strong> – A sign shingles are breaking down.</li>
      <li><strong>Uneven or Sagging Rooflines</strong> – Indicates structural stress that snow will amplify.</li>
      <li><strong>Age (15–20 Years Old)</strong> – Most roofs in Iowa need replacement around this point.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Fall is the Best Time to Replace or Repair Your Roof</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Milder Weather</strong> – Roofing crews can work safely and quickly before winter sets in.</li>
      <li><strong>Prevent Ice Dams &amp; Attic Condensation</strong> – Proper ventilation and underlayment now protect against freeze–thaw cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>Beat the Insurance Deadlines</strong> – Many hail and storm claims need to be filed before year’s end.</li>
      <li><strong>Peace of Mind</strong> – Head into winter knowing your roof will keep your family warm and dry.</li>
    </ul>
