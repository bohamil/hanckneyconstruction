      <h1>Roof Rejuvenation vs. Replacement in South Central Iowa (2025 Cost & Decision Guide)</h1>
      <p class="lead">If your shingles are drying out but the roof isn’t shot, rejuvenation can buy years. If the shingles are curling, cracking, and leaking, stop dragging it out—replace it. Here’s the hard line on how to decide, what it costs, and when each option actually makes sense in our freeze-thaw, wind, and hail climate.</p>

    <h2>Quick Take: Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Choose <em>Rejuvenation</em> when:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Shingles are <strong>10–20 years</strong> old with <strong>granule loss</strong> and dryness but <strong>no active leaks</strong>.</li>
          <li>Tabs are <strong>flat</strong> (minimal curling), decking is solid, and flashings are sound.</li>
          <li>You want to <strong>extend life 3–5 years</strong> before a full replacement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">This is a maintenance play. It won’t fix structural or installation defects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Choose <em>Replacement</em> when:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leaks</strong>, soft spots, or <strong>widespread curling/cracking</strong> are present.</li>
          <li>Major hail impact, broken seals, or chronic ice-dam damage at eaves.</li>
          <li>Roof is <strong>20–25+ years</strong> or past manufacturer life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">This is the only honest choice if the system is failing. Rejuvenation won’t rescue a dead roof.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What Rejuvenation Actually Does</h2>
    <p>Rejuvenation is a <strong>bio-based asphalt rejuvenator treatment</strong> applied to aging shingles. It re-softens the asphalt binder so shingles flex better and shed water more reliably. Think of it like conditioner for a dehydrated roof—<em>not</em> a new roof, not a band-aid for rot, and not a leak patch.</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Local reality check:</strong> In Warren, Marion, and Lucas Counties, the <em>biggest value</em> of rejuvenation is getting through more freeze-thaw cycles without cracking and keeping granules attached after windy fall storms.
    </div>

    <h2>2025 Cost Snapshot (Iowa Typical Ranges)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rejuvenation:</strong> commonly a fraction of replacement (often 15–30% of a new roof, depending on roof size/complexity).</li>
      <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> varies by shingle class, underlayment, ventilation, tear-off layers, and roof complexity (valleys, dormers, pitch).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Note: Insurance usually <em>does not</em> cover rejuvenation. Wind/hail replacements may be covered if damage meets policy criteria.</p>

    <h2>7-Point Decision Checklist (Pass/Fail)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Leaks:</strong> Active interior stains or wet decking? → <em>Replace.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Decking:</strong> Soft underfoot, sagging lines? → <em>Replace.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Curling:</strong> Tabs lifting or edges curled > 1/8–1/4"? → <em>Replace.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Granules:</strong> Steady loss but mat intact? → <em>Rejuvenation can help.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Flashings:</strong> Step/chimney flashings tight and not rusted? → <em>Rejuvenation viable.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Poor attic airflow causing heat/ice issues? → <em>Fix venting first.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Age:</strong> 10–20 yrs, structurally sound? → <em>Rejuvenation OK.</em> 20–25+ yrs with multiple issues? → <em>Replace.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Pros & Cons at a Glance</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Rejuvenation — Pros</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower cost, quick install, minimal mess</li>
          <li>Can add 3–5 years if roof is otherwise sound</li>
          <li>Helps shingles resist drying, cracking, and granule loss</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rejuvenation — Cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Won’t fix leaks, rot, bad flashing, or poor ventilation</li>
          <li>Not a substitute for an end-of-life roof</li>
          <li>Usually not insurance-eligible</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Replacement — Pros</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>New warranty, full system reset (underlayment, flashings, vents)</li>
          <li>Best option for hail/wind damage and chronic leaks</li>
          <li>Improves curb appeal and resale</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Replacement — Cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher cost and more disruption during install</li>
          <li>Lead times during peak season</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Timing Matters in Iowa</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fall (now):</strong> Great for rejuvenation on sound roofs—cooler temps, prep for snow and ice.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-winter replacements:</strong> Doable if temperatures and adhesives cooperate. Ice/water shield at eaves is non-negotiable.</li>
      <li><strong>Spring storm season:</strong> Schedule early. Don’t wait for a backlog after hail hits Warren/Marion County.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ: Rejuvenation vs. Replacement</h2>
    <h3>Will rejuvenation void my shingle warranty?</h3>
    <p>Most older roofs are already <em>out</em> of warranty. If you still have coverage, we’ll check the fine print and advise straight.</p>

    <h3>How long does roof rejuvenation last?</h3>
    <p>Typically you’re buying <strong>3–5 years</strong> on a roof that’s otherwise in good shape. Your mileage depends on installation quality, ventilation, and storm exposure.</p>

    <h3>Can rejuvenation stop a current leak?</h3>
    <p>No. It’s not a leak repair product. Leaks, rot, and failed flashings require actual fixes—or replacement.</p>

    <h3>What temperature is best for application?</h3>
    <p>Moderate, dry weather is ideal (common in early fall here). We watch the forecast and schedule accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Is replacement better for resale?</h3>
    <p>Yes. A new roof is a clean slate for buyers and inspectors. Rejuvenation is a maintenance extension, not a reset.</p>
