    <p>After big storms, out-of-town roofers — aka “storm chasers” — swarm small towns with fast offers and flashy flyers. Some are fine. Some are flat-out frauds. Protect your home and your money by asking these:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>📍 Are you licensed to work in this state?</li>
      <li>🏠 Do you have local references?</li>
      <li>🛠 Who installs the roof — your crew or subcontractors?</li>
      <li>📄 Will you give me a written warranty and contract?</li>
      <li>🕵️‍♂️ What happens if I have an issue 6 months later?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Local matters. Hackney Construction is based right here in South Central Iowa. We live here, work here, and stand by our work.</p>
