    <p>Your roof shields your home from hail, wind, snow, and summer heat. But even the best roofing system won‚Äôt last forever. Homeowners across <strong>Indianola, Osceola, Corydon</strong> and the surrounding South Central Iowa communities often ask us:</p>
    <p><strong>‚ÄúHow do I know when it‚Äôs time to replace my roof instead of just repairing it?‚Äù</strong></p>
    <p>Here are the five biggest warning signs to watch for.</p>

    <h2>1. Age of Your Roof</h2>
    <p>Most asphalt shingle roofs last <strong>20‚Äì25 years</strong> in Iowa‚Äôs climate. Metal roofs can last 40‚Äì50 years, but shingles wear out faster due to hail and hot summers. If your roof is nearing its expected lifespan, start planning for a replacement.</p>

    <h2>2. Shingle Damage</h2>
    <p>Watch for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing or curled shingles</li>
      <li>Cracked or brittle shingles</li>
      <li>Granules collecting in your gutters after a storm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These signs mean your shingles are breaking down and no longer protecting your home. Hail damage, common in South Central Iowa, often accelerates this process.</p>

    <h2>3. Leaks or Water Stains</h2>
    <p>Water stains on ceilings or walls show your roof has been compromised. Even a small leak can lead to mold, damaged insulation, or rotten decking if ignored.</p>

    <h2>4. Sagging or Uneven Roof Deck</h2>
    <p>If your roofline looks warped or sagging, the underlying decking may be weakened by water damage. This is a serious red flag that usually calls for replacement.</p>

    <h2>5. Rising Energy Bills</h2>
    <p>A worn-out roof doesn‚Äôt insulate properly. If your heating and cooling bills are climbing, your roof could be letting air escape. A new roof improves efficiency and saves money over time.</p>

    <h2>Why Replacing Your Roof Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects against expensive water damage</li>
      <li>Boosts your home‚Äôs resale value</li>
      <li>Improves energy efficiency</li>
      <li>Provides peace of mind during Iowa‚Äôs storm season</li>
    </ul>
