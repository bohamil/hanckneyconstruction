      </div>
      <p class="lead">When a storm rolls through or your shingles start curling, most homeowners type “roofers near me” into Google and hope for the best. With hundreds of thousands of searches every month for “roof repair near me,” you’re not alone—but search results don’t tell you who will actually protect your home, your budget, and your warranty.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The roofer you choose matters more than the shingle brand you buy. A trustworthy contractor keeps water out, fights for you with insurance, and stands behind their work long after the last nail is driven.
      </div>

      <h2>Step 1: Look Beyond “Roofers Near Me”</h2>
      <p>Typing the phrase is only the beginning. Drill into the people and processes behind each company before you invite them onto your roof.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer reviews:</strong> Read past the star rating. Look for consistent mentions of punctuality, fair pricing, excellent cleanup, and problems resolved after the invoice is paid.</li>
        <li><strong>Certifications &amp; licensing:</strong> Ask for proof of an Iowa contractor license, liability insurance, and workers’ compensation. Manufacturer certifications show the crew is trained to install specific systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Local experience:</strong> Roofing in Southern Iowa means planning for hail, 40° temperature swings, and snow loads. Choose a contractor who understands our building codes and weather patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>References:</strong> Request at least two recent projects. Knock on the door, ask about communication, and check how the roof is aging.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Search the business name plus terms like “complaint,” “lawsuit,” or “BBB” to surface red flags that glossy websites might hide.
      </div>

      <h2>Step 2: Know Whether You Need Roof Repair or Replacement</h2>
      <p>“Roof replacement cost” is one of the most searched phrases because homeowners aren’t sure which route is smarter. Start with an honest inspection, then weigh the scope of damage against the age of the roof.</p>
      <div class="comparison-grid">
        <div class="panel">
          <h3>Roof Repair Works Best When…</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Damage is isolated (missing shingles, a lifted flashing, one bad pipe boot).</li>
            <li>The roof is under 15 years old and otherwise healthy.</li>
            <li>Storm damage is confined to one area and your decking is still solid.</li>
            <li>You need a fast, budget-friendly fix between major projects.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h3>Roof Replacement Is Smarter When…</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Leaks are showing up in multiple rooms or you see water stains on ceilings.</li>
            <li>Shingles are brittle, curling, or losing granules across several slopes.</li>
            <li>The roof is nearing the end of its 20–25 year lifespan (or older for metal).</li>
            <li>Insurance will cover hail or wind damage once the system is replaced.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>At Hackney Roofing, we provide free, photo-documented inspections so you can compare the long-term costs of continued repairs versus a full system replacement.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Compare Roofing Materials Before You Sign</h2>
      <p>Search trends show growing curiosity about “metal roofing” and “architectural shingles.” Each material has trade-offs worth discussing with your contractor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asphalt shingles:</strong> The most popular option for Chariton, Knoxville, and Corydon homes thanks to affordability, color variety, and quick install times.</li>
        <li><strong>Metal roofing:</strong> Offers exceptional longevity, superior wind resistance, and energy efficiency. Ideal for homeowners who plan to stay put and want a lower-maintenance roof.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialty systems:</strong> Impact-resistant shingles, designer profiles, and low-slope membranes may qualify for insurance discounts or extended warranties.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Discuss how each option affects warranty coverage, ventilation upgrades, and the look of your home. A reputable roofer will explain pros, cons, and the total installed price before you sign.</p>

      <h2>Step 4: Plan for Emergency Roof Repair</h2>
      <p>Storms in Southern Iowa don’t wait for business hours. When someone searches “emergency roof repair near me,” they need tarps on fast—and a team that documents damage for insurance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the contractor has an after-hours line and a process for temporary protection.</li>
        <li>Ask how they handle interior mitigation if a leak damages drywall or insulation.</li>
        <li>Request an estimated response window for hail, wind, and tree damage events.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>Fast action within 24 hours can be the difference between a quick ceiling patch and a full-scale remodel. Make emergency support part of your hiring checklist—not an afterthought.</blockquote>

      <h2>Questions to Ask Before You Hire</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Who will be on-site supervising the crew each day?</li>
        <li>Can you walk me through your cleanup process and magnet sweep?</li>
        <li>How will you protect my landscaping, siding, and attic ventilation?</li>
        <li>What workmanship warranty do you offer, and how do I schedule follow-up service?</li>
        <li>Will you meet with my insurance adjuster if we file a storm claim?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQ: Finding the Best Roofing Contractor Near You</h2>
      <h3>How many bids should I collect before choosing a roofer?</h3>
      <p>Two to three detailed bids are usually enough. Compare scope, materials, cleanup plans, warranties, and payment schedules—not just price. If one estimate is dramatically cheaper, make sure nothing critical was left out.</p>

      <h3>What should be included in a roofing contract?</h3>
      <p>Look for a start date, projected completion date, material list, payment milestones, warranty terms, proof of insurance, and how change orders will be handled. Never sign a vague or handwritten agreement.</p>

      <h3>Can my insurance help pay for roof repairs or replacement?</h3>
      <p>Yes, when hail or wind damage is verified. Hackney Roofing documents storm damage, meets with your adjuster, and helps you navigate paperwork so you receive the coverage you’re owed.</p>
