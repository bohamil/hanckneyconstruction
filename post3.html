    <p>Fresh Roof is a soy-based roof rejuvenation spray that restores shingle flexibility, improves granule retention, and extends roof life — without a full replacement. It’s perfect for homeowners who want more value out of their current roof.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧴 Penetrates deep to rejuvenate brittle shingles</li>
      <li>🌦 Improves performance in Iowa’s harsh freeze-thaw cycles</li>
      <li>💰 Costs a fraction of replacement</li>
      <li>🛡 Backed by a 5-year transferable warranty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ask us if your roof qualifies for Fresh Roof. It could save you thousands and buy you more time before a full tear-off is needed.</p>
